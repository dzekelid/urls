description: Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managedDockercontainer
  registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container
  images. Amazon ECR is integrated withAmazon EC2 Container Service (ECS), simplifying
  your development to production workflow. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate
  your own container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure.
  Amazon ECR hosts your images in a highly available and scalable architecture, allowing
  you to reliably deploy containers for your applications. Integration with AWS Identity
  and Access Management (IAM) provides resource-level control of each repository.
  With Amazon ECR, there are no upfront fees or commitments. You pay only for the
  amount of data you store in your repositories and data transferred to the Internet.
